In each file, we compute 

1. the invariant n for the corresponding tuple (n_1,n_2,n_3)
2. a set of coset representatives for Γ1[n] (we check that Ψn is trivial),
3. a p-expansion of all the corresponding Fa,b and the resulting q-expansion of Θn,
4. the degree of P the polynomial in J and its coefficients, such that P_n (J) = Θ_n / ∆^(r/12) , identifying
the coefficients of the q-expansions,
5. the roots of Pn, i.e. the modular invariants of the elliptic curves corresponding to the dessins with invariant n.
